# World of Warcraft

This is a course project for ***Practice of Programming in C&C++*** in Peking University.

The course project aims to improve students' skills on object-oriented programming.

The first and second parts are relatively simple, and the third and ultimate ones are much more complicated, so reference data is offered.

Feel free to refer to the data and source codes, but you must do it on your own!
